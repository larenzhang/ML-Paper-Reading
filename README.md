# Preliminary: how to read a paper efficiently?(By Prof. Pete Carr)
## 1. Structure of a journal article:
    1). Title
    2). Keywords
    3). Abstract
    4). Introduction
    5). Experiment
    6). Results and discussion
    7). Summary/conclusions
    8). Reference

**Notes**: Don't read paper from the beginning to the end of the article. It's not a good use of your time.
## 2. A fairly simple algorithm to get the most out of the paper with the least effort with two phase process.
### First phase: how to survey the paper?
    1).Read the title and keywords
    2).Read the abstract
    3).Read the conclusions
### Second phase: how to read the paper?
    1).look at the tables and figures (including captions). This is what was done in the work.This doesn't take much time so it is worth looking at before really getting into details which will slow down the reading.
    2).Read the introduction. This is the background needed and why the study was done.
    3).Read the results and conclusions. This is the heart of the paper.
    4).Read the experiment. This is how they did the work. You only get to this point if you are really interested and need to understand exactly what was done to better understand the meaning of the data and its interpretation. 


At last, it's nececcary to write paper notes. **The faintest writing is better than the best memory!**
